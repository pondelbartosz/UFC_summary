# UFC_summary

## Description
The goal of the project was to create a summary of several important statistics from UFC history. To achive this, three separate tables with information about UFC (ufc_fights, ufc_fighters, ufc_locations) were combined. Then, data cleaning and analysis were conducted. Using statistical knowledge, the ability to use pivot tables, and data visualization skills, summaries meeting the project objectives were created and  included in a presentation.
